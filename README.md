# React Useless Hooks

A collection of [React Custom Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-custom.html) that should not belong anywhere.

## Contribution

- Create a new hook in `src/hooks` folder.
- Show example usage in `src/App.tsx`.
- If you don't know TypeScript, simply use `any` type or predefined [`DefinitelyNotAny`](./src/vite-env.d.ts) type

## TODOs

You can help us on these meta-tasks, too.

- [ ] Add more useless hooks
- [ ] Remove useful hooks
- [ ] Publish to NPM
- [ ] Write some less-useless HTML & CSS for the home page
- [ ] ~~Add Tests~~ Nah, that seems useful
